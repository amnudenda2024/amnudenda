We are let in on intimate and banal personal histories as the camera slowly examines details of the house's idiosyncrasies.</p>      <p>In <em>Actions at Home </em> David Bestu&eacute; &amp; Marc Vives contrive a series of situations which are part pastiche, part homage to the history of video performance.</p>      <p>In Viola Yesiltac's <em>For Annelise </em> it appears as though we observe the living room from the position of the television, as the artist's cousin plays the piano for Yesiltac's grandmother, a former music teacher, as they meet for the first time.</p>      <p>In vivid, almost violent colour, <em>Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling </em> by Michel Auder sees women wrestle each other in a video that slides between being soft porn and a comi-tragic bout of popular entertainment.</p>      <p>By editing together movie clips from a succession of Tom Cruise films, Jack Strange's work <em>Tom </em> sees the pin-up movie star seamlessly run from one role to another, back to the beginning of his career.</p>      <p>In <em>Touch My Body (Green Screen Version) </em> Oliver Laric inverts the role of the ubiquitous green screen, used to lay artificial backgrounds over high budget video productions. Mariah Carey invites us, context-less, to 'touch my body'. She becomes a comic puppet, dissolving the illusory fa&ccedil;ade of the pop video at the same time as providing a YouTube remix opportunity for fans. </p>      </div>      </th>  </tr></table><div align="left"></div><p class="style5"><br>  _____________________ </p><p class="style5">Am Nuden Da is an independent artist-run space in East London.<br>  <br>  Am Nuden Da<br>  7 Ravenscroft Street London E2 7SH<br>  nuden@amnudenda.com<br>  <span class="style1">www.amnudenda.com </span><strong><em><br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong></p></div><p class="style1"><strong><em>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong></p><script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
