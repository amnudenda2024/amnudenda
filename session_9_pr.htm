The work proclaims a somewhat absurd notion; that of the whole world as a work of art. As an homage to, and proposed extension of Manzoni&rsquo;s thinking, Am Nuden Da will show the work in the gallery without physically moving it from its home in the Herning Kunstmuseum. The gesture provides a framework within which to show the work of five other artists who in different ways evaluate the nature of objects, materials and conceptual practice.<br>        <br>        Vanessa Billy and Lydia Gifford are both making new works in response to the idea of the Manzoni piece and its inclusion in this show.<br>        <br>        The works included by David Bellingham, Mauricio Guill&eacute;n and Si&ocirc;n Parkinson draw on different strategies as a means to engage with thoughts surrounding post (and pre) conceptual object making. Reductive and additive techniques are apparent, perhaps as a paradox, as is the readymade, appropriation and manipulation, and the role of language and its relationship to the materialistic as a tool for the exchange of ideas, and the negotiation of meaning.<br>        <br>    By means of his dedication, Manzoni pulls into a parallax perspective the epistemological turn brought about by Galileo&rsquo;s observations. This reference operates in a twofold manner, acknowledging the scientist&rsquo;s conceptual and political position and re-capturing the natural, the worldly and the physical to art; a radically incisive gesture that echoes into contemporary approaches.</div></th>  </tr></table><div align="left" class="style1"></div><p class="style5"><br>  _____________________ </p><p class="style5">Am Nuden Da is an independent artist-run space in East London.<br>    <br>  Am Nuden Da<br>  7 Ravenscroft Street London E2 7SH<br>  nuden@amnudenda.com<br>  <span class="style1">www.amnudenda.com </span><strong><em><br></em></strong></p><p><span class="style1"><strong><em><br></em></strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="style1"><strong><em><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong></span>      <script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
