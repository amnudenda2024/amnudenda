There are 12 of them, 8 guys and 4 girls. The young man in question picks up a football and kicks it to an immense height. As it reappears and hits the ground it collapses. The moment creates a situation of dismay and yet the flat ball quickly establishes a new status as a trophy of sorts. </p>        <p>A middle-aged woman, English looking, well dressed, enters the park at approximately the same time near Buckingham Palace, from the north-western side. She makes her way down towards the lake and eventually crosses the bridge from where one has a perhaps sublime view of several London landmarks. She stops for a moment as a deliberate obstacle comes to mind, that moment of physiological disorientation makes her stumble, she falls flat on her face and looses sight of the eye for a while. </p>        <p>Simultaneously, an exact copy of the great American artist Richard Serra's <em>Tilted Arc</em> from 1981 is revealed on the gravelled planes just behind 10 Downing Street. The sculpture finds immediate praise for its dual function as public artwork and counter terrorism device. <em>This is a wonderful marriage of the rational and the irrational </em> a man is heard shouting. The sculpture is planned to remain in place until the end of the Olympic year. <em>The opposition voted against the move.<br>          <br>          <br>        </em>Am Nuden Da invites you for drinks on Sunday the 7th August 2011 from 5-6pm in the Nash room at the ICA, London. </p>        </div></th>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="style1"><strong><em><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong><strong><em><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong></p>  <script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
