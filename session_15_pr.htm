Inform on matters that you are about to encounter. Matter seems an appropriate place to start, if anything this show is about <em>matter</em> in its entire register.</p>              <p class="style2"><em>Material</em>, that which constitutes - there are the obvious or traditional, and then the modern and non-existent. We appear to have found a place where they manage to co-exist, one where they matter less. (Matter exists too here in its negative, the <em>de</em>- of material.)</p>              <p class="style2"><em>Subject</em>, that which narrates - persuades the maker to set out on a journey, and also enables the ensuing encounter with a viewer. It will hold several possibilities, yet always find its distinctive voice when met accordingly and given time. (Through the process of recognition - aesthetic and ethical - a subject is at the same time an individual standing before the work)</p>              <p class="style2"><em>Question</em>, that which reasons - query as a means for change, ones personal-political duty. A phenomenon with effect when posed and appreciated. A philosophical stance we all inhabit, and one for which art is to encourage. (Matters)</p>              <p class="style2">As you turn around, and make your way to the back of the gallery, a deliberate obstacle comes to mind. When contemplated, a sense of confusion and ease gather. The paradoxical nature of experience makes her stumble; luckily she landed yielding. </p>              <p class="style2">This exhibition is about the task inherent to the press release. Where does interpretation and engagement with text sit in relation to the experience one has with visual art? How does a curatorial practice negotiate a pre-existing press release that is handed over to act for a yet non-existent exhibition?</p>              <p class="style2">This press release was written by Am Nuden Da.</p>              <p class="style2">Session_15_<em>Press Release</em> is curated by FormContent.</p>      </div></th>    </tr>  </table></div><p class="style1"><strong><em><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong><strong><em><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong></p>  <script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
