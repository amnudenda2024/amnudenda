All pieces are set in Arial, <em>the</em> default typeface, at point 10 size. This dogmatic method represents an attempt to foreground language ahead of design, layout and graphic appearance. </p>        <p class="style1">The nature of the exhibition in many respects owes its being to the conceptual art of the 1960s. Here, the denial of object is emphasised by the operations of modern logistics &ndash; the email allows for artworks to be virtually &lsquo;shipped&rsquo; from all over the world, leaving and arriving as nothing but <em>thought</em>. The mechanisms of information technology seems somewhat like a logical extension of the conceptual project of previous generations.</p>        <p class="style1">Session_7_Words includes works by artists of several generations, presenting an insight into what written language constitutes within a broad range of contemporary art practices. The levelling parameters of presentation that have been imposed by the curators are intended to set such generational concerns aside and open the works up for a more general study. </p>        <p class="style1">The exhibition is curated by Am Nuden Da and Material to coincide with the launch of Material (Issue 2) at London&rsquo;s Whitechapel Gallery on Thursday 3rd December.</p>        </div>      </th>  </tr></table><div align="left">  <p class="style1"><br>_____________________  </p>  <p class="style1">Material, first published in 2007 is an annual LA based journal of writing by artists.<br>    www.materialpress.org</p>  <p class="style1">_____________________</p>  <p class="style1">Am Nuden Da is an independent artist-run space in East London.</p>  <p class="style1">Am Nuden Da<br>    7 Ravenscroft Street London E2 7SH<br>    nuden@amnudenda.com<br>    www.amnudenda.com</p>  <strong><em><br>    <br>    <br></em></strong></div></div><p class="style1"><strong><em>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  </em></strong></p><script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
